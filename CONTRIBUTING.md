## How to Submit Change Requests

Please submit change requests and / or features via [Issues](https://github.com/equinix/terraform-provider-equinix/issues). There's no guarantee it'll be changed, but you never know until you try. We'll try to add comments as soon as possible, though.

## Pull Requests
All resource and data source changes must be reflected in the documentation, including new attributes and changes to existing attributes. The documentation is generated via `make docs`.  For more detailed instructions for updating docs, see ["Documenting the provider" in the development guide](./DEVELOPMENT.md#documenting-the-provider).

 - test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
 - build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
