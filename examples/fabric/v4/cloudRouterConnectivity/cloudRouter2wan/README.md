* `equinix_client_id` - Equinix client ID (consumer key), obtained after
  registering app in the developer platform
* `equinix_client_secret` - Equinix client secret ID (consumer secret),
  obtained same way as above

`fcr_uuid` - UUID of ECX Fabric Cloud Router on a-side
`network_uuid` - UUID of ipwan network on z-side
`connection_name` - the name of the connection
`connection_type` - connection type, please refer schema
`notifications_type` - notification type
`notifications_emails` - List of emails
`purchase_order_number` - Purchase order number
`bandwidth` - bandwidth in MBs
`aside_ap_type` - Fabric Cloud Router type
`zside_ap_type` - Z side access point type, ipwan

## Initialize
- First step is to initialize the terraform directory/resource we are going to work on.
  In the given example, the folder to perform CRUD operations on a fcr2wan connection can be found at examples/fcr2port/.

- Change directory into - `CD examples/fabric/v4/cloudRouterConnectivity/cloudRouter2wan/`
- Initialize Terraform plugins - `terraform init`
