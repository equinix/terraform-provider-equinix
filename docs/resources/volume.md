# metal\_volume

Provides an Equinix Metal Block Storage Volume resource to allow you to
manage block volumes on your account.
Once created by Terraform, they must then be attached and mounted
using the api and `metal_block_attach` and `metal_block_detach`
scripts.

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Create a new block volume
resource "metal_volume" "volume1" {
  description   = "terraform-volume-1"
  facility      = "ny5"
  project_id    = local.project_id
  plan          = "storage_1"
  size          = 100
  billing_cycle = "hourly"

  snapshot_policies {
    snapshot_frequency = "1day"
    snapshot_count     = 7
  }

  snapshot_policies {
    snapshot_frequency = "1month"
    snapshot_count     = 6
  }
}
