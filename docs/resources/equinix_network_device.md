# equinix_network_device (Resource)

Resource `equinix_network_device` allows creation and management of Equinix Network Edge virtual
network devices.

Network Edge virtual network devices can be created in two modes:

* **managed** - (default) Where Equinix manages connectivity and services in the device and
customer gets limited access to the device.
* **self-configured** - Where customer provisions and manages own services in the device with less
restricted access. Some device types are offered only in this mode.

In addition to management modes, there are two software license modes available:

* **subscription** - Where Equinix provides software license, including end-to-end support, and
bills for the service respectively.
* **BYOL** - [bring your own license] Where customer brings his own, already procured device
software license. There are no charges associated with such license. It is the only licensing mode
for `self-configured` devices.

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Create pair of redundant, managed CSR1000V routers with license subscription
# in two different metro locations

data "equinix_network_account" "dc" {
  metro_code = "DC"
}
