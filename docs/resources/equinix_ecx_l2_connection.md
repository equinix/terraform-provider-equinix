selected.
* `service_token`- (Required when `port_uuid` or `device_uuid` are not set) - A-side
service tokens authorize you to create a connection from a customer port, which created the token
for you, to a service profile or your own port.
More details in [A-Side Fabric Service Tokens](https://docs.equinix.com/en-us/Content/Interconnection/Fabric/service%20tokens/Fabric-Service-Tokens.htm#:~:text=the%20service%20token.-,A%2DSide%20Service%20Tokens,-If%20you%20want).
* `zside_service_token`- (Required when `profile_uuid` or `zside_port_uuid` are not set) - Z-side
service tokens authorize you to create a connection from your port or virtual device to a customer
port which created the token for you. `zside_service_token` cannot be used with `secondary_connection`.
More details in [Z-Side Fabric Service Tokens](https://docs.equinix.com/en-us/Content/Interconnection/Fabric/service%20tokens/Fabric-Service-Tokens.htm#:~:text=requirements%20per%20provider.-,Z%2DSide%20Service%20Tokens,-If%20you%20want).

-> **NOTE:** Service tokens can't be reused. To recreate a resource or to create a new one for
another connection even from same interconnection asset, you will need to request another token
from your service provider.

* `vlan_stag` - (Required when port_uuid is set) S-Tag/Outer-Tag of the connection - a numeric

Valid values: `PRIVATE`, `MICROSOFT`, `MANUAL`\*, `PUBLIC`\*.

~> **NOTE:** _"MANUAL"_ peering is deprecated. Use _"PRIVATE"_ or _"MICROSOFT"_ instead. It was
used in cases where `zside_vlan_ctag` was needed. `zside_vlan_ctag` can still be defined without
need to specify `MANUAL` which does not actually correspond to any type of peering supported in
Azure. Check [how to create a connection to Microsoft Azure ExpressRoute with Equinix Fabric](https://docs.equinix.com/en-us/Content/Interconnection/Fabric/connections/Fabric-ms-azure.htm#:~:text=a%20peering%20type.-,(Optional)%C2%A0,-Enter%20a%20vlan)
for more details.

side (z-side) - a numeric character ranging from 2 - 4094.
* `zside_vlan_ctag` - (Optional) C-Tag/Inner-Tag of the connection on the remote/destination
side (z-side) - a numeric character ranging from 2 - 4094.
`secondary_connection` is defined it will internally use same `zside_vlan_ctag` for the secondary
connection.
* `seller_region` - (Optional) The region in which the seller port resides.
* `seller_metro_code` - (Optional) The metro code that denotes the connectionâ€™s remote/destination
side (z-side).
* `authorization_key` - (Optional) Unique identifier authorizing Equinix to provision a connection
towards a cloud service provider. At Equinix, an `Authorization Key` is a generic term and is NOT
encrypted on Equinix Fabric. Cloud Service Providers might use a different name to refer to this
key such as `Service Key` or `Authentication Key`. Value depends on a provider service profile,
more information on [Equinix Fabric how to guide](https://developer.equinix.com/docs/ecx-how-to-guide).
* `secondary_connection` - (Optional) Definition of secondary connection for redundant, HA
connectivity. See [Secondary Connection](#secondary-connection) below for more details.

### Secondary Connection

-> **NOTE:** Some service provider do not directly support redundant connections in their service
profiles. However, some of them offer active/active (BGP multipath) or active/passive (failover)
configurations in their platforms and you still achieve that highly resilient network
connections by creating an `equinix_ecx_l2_connection` resource for each connection instead of
defining a `secondary_connection` block.

The `secondary_connection` block supports the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) secondary connection name
* `speed` - (Optional) Speed/Bandwidth to be allocated to the secondary connection. If not
specified primary `speed` will be used.
* `speed_unit` - (Optional) Unit of the speed/bandwidth to be allocated to the secondary
connection. If not specified primary `speed_unit` will be used.
* `port_uuid` - (Optional) Applicable with primary `port_uuid`. Identifier of the Equinix Fabric Port from
which the secondary connection would originate. If not specified primary `port_uuid` will be used.
* `device_uuid` - (Optional) Applicable with primary `device_uuid`. Identifier of the Network Edge
virtual device from which the secondary connection would originate. If not specified primary
`device_uuid` will be used.
* `device_interface_id` - (Optional) Applicable with `device_uuid`, identifier of network interface
on a given device. If not specified then first available interface will be selected.
* `service_token`- (Optional) Required with primary `service_token`. Unique Equinix Fabric key
given by a provider that grants you authorization to enable connectivity from an Equinix Fabric Port or
virtual device. Each connection (primary and secondary) requires a separate token.
More details in [Fabric Service Tokens](https://docs.equinix.com/en-us/Content/Interconnection/Fabric/service%20tokens/Fabric-Service-Tokens.htm).
* `vlan_stag` - (Required when `port_uuid` is set) S-Tag/Outer-Tag of the secondary connection, a
numeric character ranging from 2 - 4094.
* `vlan_ctag` - (Optional) Applicable with `port_uuid`. C-Tag/Inner-Tag of the secondary
connection, a numeric character ranging from 2 - 4094.
* `seller_metro_code` - (Optional) The metro code that denotes the secondary connectionâ€™s
destination (Z side). .
* `seller_region` - (Optional) The region in which the seller port resides. If not specified
primary `seller_region` will be used.
* `authorization_key` - (Optional) Unique identifier authorizing Equinix to provision a connection
towards a cloud service provider. If not specified primary `authorization_key` will be used. However,
some service providers may require different keys for each connection. More information on
[Equinix Fabric how to guide](https://developer.equinix.com/docs/ecx-how-to-guide).

## Update operation behavior

Update of most arguments will force replacement of a connection (including related redundant
connection in HA setup).

Following arguments can be updated. **NOTE** that Equinix Fabric may still forbid updates depending
on current connection state, used service provider or number of updates requested during the day.

* `name`
* `speed` and `speed_unit`

## Timeouts

This resource provides the following [Timeouts configuration](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts)
options:

* create - Default is 5 minutes
* delete - Default is 5 minutes

## Import

-> **NOTE:** Connections created with a Service Token (both a-side/z-side), will populate the token
into `vendor_token` but `service_token` and `zside_service_token` will remain empty.

Equinix L2 connections can be imported using an existing `id`:

```sh
existing_connection_id='example-uuid-1'
terraform import equinix_ecx_l2_connection.example ${existing_connection_id}
```

-> **NOTE:** To import a redundant connection you must concatenate `id` of both connections
(primary and secondary) into a single string separated by `:`.

To import a redundant Equinix L2 connection:

```sh
existing_primary_connection_id='example-uuid-1'
existing_secondary_connection_id='example-uuid-2'
terraform import equinix_ecx_l2_connection.example ${existing_primary_connection_id}:${existing_secondary_connection_id}
```
