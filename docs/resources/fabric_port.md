# equinix_fabric_port (Resource)

Fabric V4 API compatible resource allows creation and management of Equinix Fabric Ports

Additional Documentation:
* Getting Started: https://docs.equinix.com/en-us/Content/Interconnection/Fabric/ports/fabric-order-port.htm
* API: https://developer.equinix.com/catalog/fabricv4#operation/createPort

~> ** NOTE:** This resource is in beta and is subject to change. Please use with caution. Experimental resource may contain bugs and is not recommended for production use.
* There are no guarantees that a Port Reservation will occur after creating a port order through Terraform
* If a Port Reservation does not occur then the Port Order is not complete and the Terraform resource will not be able to be used as a dependency
* Port Deletions are not a short process and can take 2-5 business days to complete
* Please be advised that a re-run of the Terraform resource with the same settings may not result in an available Port for Reservation even if the previous one was Completed

## Example Usage
