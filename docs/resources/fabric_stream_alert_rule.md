## Example Usage

```terraform

  stream_id          = "<stream_id>"
  name               = "<name>"
  type               = "METRIC_ALERT"
  description        = "<description>"
  enabled            = true
  operand            = "ABOVE"
  window_size        = "<window_size>"
  warning_threshold  = "<warning_threshold>"
  critical_threshold = "<critical_threshold>"
  metric_name        = "equinix.fabric.connection.bandwidth_tx.usage"
  resource_selector = {
    include = ["*/connections/<connection_id>"]
  }
}

output "stream_alert_rule_type" {
  value = equinix_fabric_stream_alert_rule.new_stream_alert_rule.type
}

output "stream_alert_rule_id" {
  value = equinix_fabric_stream_alert_rule.new_stream_alert_rule.uuid
}

output "stream_alert_rule_stream_id" {
  value = equinix_fabric_stream_alert_rule.new_stream_alert_rule.stream_id
}

output "stream_alert_rule_state" {
  value = equinix_fabric_stream_alert_rule.new_stream_alert_rule.state
}

## Schema

### Required

- `critical_threshold` (String) Stream alert rule metric critical threshold
- `description` (String) Customer-provided stream alert rule description
- `metric_name` (String) Stream alert rule metric name
- `name` (String) Customer-provided stream alert rule name
- `operand` (String) Stream alert rule metric operand
- `stream_id` (String) The stream UUID that contains this alert rule
- `type` (String) Type of the stream alert rule
- `warning_threshold` (String) Stream alert rule metric warning threshold
- `window_size` (String) Stream alert rule metric window size

### Optional

- `enabled` (Boolean) Stream alert rule enabled status
- `resource_selector` (Attributes) Resource selector for the stream alert rule (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--resource_selector))
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `change_log` (Attributes) Details of the last change on the stream resource (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--change_log))
- `href` (String) Equinix assigned URI of the stream alert rule

### Nested Schema for `resource_selector`

Required:

- `include` (List of String) List of metrics to include


<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
