# Data Source: equinix_metal_vlan

Provides an Equinix Metal Virtual Network datasource. VLANs data sources can be
searched by VLAN UUID, or project UUID and vxlan number.

## Example Usage

Fetch a vlan by ID:

```hcl
resource "equinix_metal_vlan" "foovlan" {
        project_id = local.project_id
        metro = "sv"
        vxlan = 5
}

data "equinix_metal_vlan" "dsvlan" {
        vlan_id = equinix_metal_vlan.foovlan.id
}
```

Fetch a vlan by project ID, vxlan and metro

```hcl
resource "equinix_metal_vlan" "foovlan" {
        project_id = local.project_id
        metro = "sv"
        vxlan = 5
}

data "equinix_metal_vlan" "dsvlan" {
        project_id = local.project_id
        vxlan      = 5
        metro      = "sv"
}
```
