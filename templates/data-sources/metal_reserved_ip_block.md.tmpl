# equinix_metal_reserved_ip_block (Data Source)

Use this data source to find IP address blocks in Equinix Metal. You can use IP address or a block ID for lookup.

~> For backward compatibility, this data source can be also used for precreated (management) IP blocks.

See the [Virtual Routing and Forwarding documentation](https://deploy.equinix.com/developers/docs/metal/layer2-networking/vrf/) for product details and API reference material.

## Example Usage
