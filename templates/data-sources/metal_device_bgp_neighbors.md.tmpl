# equinix_metal_device_bgp_neighbors (Data Source)

Use this datasource to retrieve list of BGP neighbors of a device in the Equinix Metal host.

To have any BGP neighbors listed, the device must be in [BGP-enabled project](../r/project.html) and have a [BGP session](../r/bgp_session.html) assigned.

To learn more about using BGP in Equinix Metal, see the [equinix_metal_bgp_session](../r/bgp_session.html) resource documentation.

## Example Usage

{{tffile "examples/data-sources/equinix_metal_device_bgp_neighbors/example_1.tf"}}

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `device_id` - (Required) UUID of BGP-enabled device whose neighbors to list.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `bgp_neighbors` - array of BGP neighbor records with attributes:
  * `address_family` - IP address version, 4 or 6.
  * `customer_as` - Local autonomous system number.
  * `customer_ip` - Local used peer IP address.
  * `md5_enabled` - Whether BGP session is password enabled.
  * `md5_password` - BGP session password in plaintext (not a checksum).
  * `multihop` - Whether the neighbor is in EBGP multihop session.
  * `peer_as` - Peer AS number (different than customer_as for EBGP).
  * `peer_ips` - Array of IP addresses of this neighbor's peers.
  * `routes_in` - Array of incoming routes.
    * `route` - CIDR expression of route (IP/mask).
    * `exact` - (bool) Whether the route is exact.
  * `routes_out` - Array of outgoing routes in the same format.
