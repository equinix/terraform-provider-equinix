# equinix_metal_ssh_key (Resource)

Provides a resource to manage User SSH keys on your Equinix Metal user account. If you create a new device in a project, all the keys of the project's collaborators will be injected to the device.

The link between User SSH key and device is implicit. If you want to make sure that a key will be copied to a device, you must ensure that the device resource `depends_on` the key resource.
