# equinix_metal_ip_attachment (Resource)

Provides a resource to attach elastic IP subnets to devices.

To attach an IP subnet from a reserved block to a provisioned device, you must derive a subnet CIDR belonging to one of your reserved blocks in the same project and metro as the target device.

For example, you have reserved IPv4 address block `147.229.10.152/30`, you can choose to assign either the whole block as one subnet to a device; or 2 subnets with CIDRs `147.229.10.152/31` and `147.229.10.154/31`; or 4 subnets with mask prefix length `32`. More about the elastic IP subnets is [here](https://metal.equinix.com/developers/docs/networking/elastic-ips/).

Device and reserved block must be in the same metro.

## Example Usage

{{tffile "examples/resources/equinix_metal_ip_attachment/example_1.tf"}}

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `device_id` - (Required) ID of device to which to assign the subnet.
* `cidr_notation` - (Required) CIDR notation of subnet from block reserved in the same project and metro as the device.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The unique ID of the assignment.
* `device_id` - ID of device to which subnet is assigned.
* `cidr_notation` - Assigned subnet in CIDR notation, e.g., `147.229.15.30/31`
* `gateway` - IP address of gateway for the subnet.
* `network` - Subnet network address.
* `netmask` - Subnet mask in decimal notation, e.g., `255.255.255.0`.
* `cidr` - Length of CIDR prefix of the subnet as integer.
* `address_family` - Address family as integer. One of `4` or `6`.
* `public` - Boolean flag whether subnet is reachable from the Internet.
