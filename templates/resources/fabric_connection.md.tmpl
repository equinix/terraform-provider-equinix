# equinix_fabric_connection (Resource)

Fabric V4 API compatible resource allows creation and management of Equinix Fabric connection

Additional documentation:
* Getting Started: https://docs.equinix.com/en-us/Content/Interconnection/Fabric/IMPLEMENTATION/fabric-connections-implement.htm
* API: https://developer.equinix.com/dev-docs/fabric/api-reference/fabric-v4-apis#connections

## Supporting Modules

The direct usage of the resources is given in the next section "Example Usage". We also have supporting Terraform Modules that can be used to assist you with common Fabric Connection use cases.

You can find those modules along with their usage examples on the [Terraform Registry: (Fabric Terraform Modules)](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/equinix/fabric/equinix/latest)

Port to Alibaba Connection EVPL_VC Connection:

### Step by Step Instructions for the Fabric Port to Fabric Alibaba Profile Connection Example Given Below

#### 1. Create and Accept the Connection
* Create the connection using the Equinix Terraform provider
* Then manually accept the connection request in the Alibaba Portal for the created physical connection

#### 2. Delete Resources
* Run `terraform destroy` to delete the Alibaba VBR
* Directly deleting the Equinix Fabric connection, will result in the following error: `ERR-UAA-003-00: Deletion for a provisioned connection needs to be initiated from Alibaba Portal`
* Go to the Alibaba Portal to manually **terminate** and then **delete** the physical connection
* This action will automatically delete the connection on the Equinix side, updating its status to Deprovisioned on both Equinix and Provider side

### Notes:

Port to IBM Connections could be modified from IBM Service Provider Side by using parameters passed to additional_info field:
* `{"key": "ASN", "value": "1111"}`
* `{"key": "Global", "value": "false"}`
* `{"key": "BGP_IBM_CIDR", "value": "172.16.0.18/30"}`
* `{"key": "BGP_CER_CIDR", "value": "172.16.0.19/30"}`

To accept, delete, or upgrade bandwidth for IBM Connections using the 'ibm_dl_gateway_action' resource, you must update the following attribute: For Connection Approval:
- Use action = "create_gateway_approve" For Bandwidth Upgrade/Downgrade:
- Use action = "update_attributes_approve" For Connection Deletion:
- Use action = "delete_gateway_approve"
