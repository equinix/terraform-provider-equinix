# equinix_network_device (Resource)

Resource `equinix_network_device` allows creation and management of Equinix Network Edge virtual network devices.

Network Edge virtual network devices can be created in two modes:

* **managed** - (default) Where Equinix manages connectivity and services in the device and customer gets limited access to the device.
* **self-configured** - Where customer provisions and manages own services in the device with less restricted access. Some device types are offered only in this mode.

In addition to management modes, there are two software license modes available:

* **subscription** - Where Equinix provides software license, including end-to-end support, and bills for the service respectively.
* **BYOL** - [bring your own license] Where customer brings his own, already procured device software license. There are no charges associated with such license. It is the only licensing mode for `self-configured` devices.

### Secondary Device

-> **NOTE:** Network Edge provides different High Availability (HA) options. By defining a `secondary_device` block, terraform will deploy [Redundant Devices](https://docs.equinix.com/en-us/Content/Interconnection/NE/deploy-guide/Reference%20Architecture/NE-High-Availability-Options.htm#:~:text=Redundant%20Devices%20(Active/Active)), useful for customers that require two actively forwarding data planes (Active/Active) on separate hardware stacks. See [Architecting for Resiliency](https://docs.equinix.com/en-us/Content/Interconnection/NE/deploy-guide/NE-architecting-resiliency.htm) documentation to know more about the fault-tolerant solutions that you can achieve.

This option, based on vendor-specific features, allows customers to deploy more advanced resilient configurations than `secondary_device`. See [Network Edge HA Options](https://docs.equinix.com/en-us/Content/Interconnection/NE/deploy-guide/Reference%20Architecture/NE-High-Availability-Options.htm) documentation to know which vendors support clustered devices. See [Architecting for Resiliency](https://docs.equinix.com/en-us/Content/Interconnection/NE/deploy-guide/NE-architecting-resiliency.htm) documentation to know more about the fault-tolerant solutions that you can achieve.
