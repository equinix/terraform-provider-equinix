# equinix_metal_bgp_session (Resource)

Provides a resource to manage BGP sessions in Equinix Metal Host. Refer to [Equinix Metal BGP documentation](https://metal.equinix.com/developers/docs/networking/local-global-bgp/) for more details.

You need to have BGP config enabled in your project.

BGP session must be linked to a device running [BIRD](https://bird.network.cz) or other BGP routing daemon which will control route advertisements via the session to Equinix Metal's upstream routers.

## Example Usage

Following HCL illustrates usage of the BGP features in Equinix Metal. It will

* spawn a device in a new BGP-enabled project
* reserve a floating IPv4 address in the project in the same location as the device
* configure the floating IPv4 statically in the device
* install and configure [BIRD](https://bird.network.cz) in the device, and make it announce the floating IPv4 locally
